## 🎨 Styling Approach

### Decision: Traditional CSS ✅

**Reason:** Consistency with existing patient module (UserHome.css, PatientDashboard styling)

### CSS Architecture

```
Patient Module (Traditional CSS)
├── UserHome.css
└── PatientDashboard styles

Doctor Module (Traditional CSS)
├── DoctorProfileUpdate.css
└── DoctorHome.css

Mixed Approach = Consistent across both modules!
```

### Benefits Achieved:
1. ✅ Consistent styling methodology
2. ✅ Maintainable CSS structure
3. ✅ No build tool dependency for styles
4. ✅ Semantic class names
5. ✅ Easy customization
6. ✅ Team familiarity
