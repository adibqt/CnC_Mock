# 📦 Vercel Blob Storage - Summary

## ✅ Integration Complete!

Your Click & Care app now uses **Vercel Blob Storage** for all file uploads instead of local filesystem storage.

### Files Updated:
1. **Doctors API** (`backend/routers/doctors.py`)
   - Profile pictures → Vercel Blob
   - MBBS certificates → Vercel Blob
   - FCPS certificates → Vercel Blob

2. **Users API** (`backend/routers/users.py`)
   - Patient profile pictures → Vercel Blob

3. **Lab Reports API** (`backend/routers/lab_reports.py`)
   - Lab report PDFs → Vercel Blob
   - Lab report images → Vercel Blob

4. **Dependencies** (`backend/requirements.txt`)
   - Added `aiohttp==3.10.11` for async HTTP requests

## 🚀 What You Need To Do

### 1. Create Vercel Blob Storage
```
1. Go to vercel.com → Your Project → Storage
2. Click "Create Database" → Select "Blob"
3. Name: click-and-care-blob
4. Click "Create"
```

### 2. Get the Token
```
1. Go to Blob Storage → Settings
2. Copy the "Read-Write Token"
3. Looks like: vercel_blob_rw_XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### 3. Add Environment Variable
```
In Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables:

BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_XXXXXXXXXXXXX

⚠️ Add to ALL environments (Production, Preview, Development)
```

### 4. Deploy!
```
Your app will automatically use Vercel Blob on deployment.
No code changes needed!
```

## 💡 How It Works

### Development (Local):
- Files saved to `uploads/` folder
- Works without blob token
- Perfect for testing

### Production (Vercel):
- Automatically detects Vercel environment
- Uploads to Vercel Blob Storage
- Returns public CDN URLs
- Fast global access
