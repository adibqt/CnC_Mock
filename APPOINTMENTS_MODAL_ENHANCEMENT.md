# Appointments Modal Enhancement

## Changes Made

### Issue
The appointments were appearing below the "My Activities" section when clicking the Schedule button, which wasn't very prominent or user-friendly.

### Solution

- Maximum height: 80vh (80% of viewport height)
- Beautiful shadow for depth
- Smooth slide-up animation
- Rounded corners

### 3. **Sticky Header**
- Header stays at top when scrolling through appointments
- Clean separation with border
- Close button always visible
- Blue calendar icon for visual clarity

### 4. **Enhanced Close Button**
- Larger size (40x40px)
- Hover effect: turns red with rotation animation
- Better visibility

### 5. **Custom Scrollbar**
- Slim design (8px width)

### 6. **Mobile Responsive**
