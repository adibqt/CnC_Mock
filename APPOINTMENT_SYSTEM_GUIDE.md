# Appointment System Implementation - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Overview

A comprehensive appointment booking system has been implemented for the Click & Care medical platform, enabling patients to book appointments with doctors and doctors to manage their weekly schedules.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** ✓
- Created `appointments` table with:
  - Patient and doctor references
  - Appointment date and time slot
  - Status management (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled, no_show)
  - Symptoms and notes fields
  - Timestamps and indexes for performance
  - Unique constraint preventing double-booking

**Migration:** `backend/migrations/migrate_appointments.py`

### 2. **Backend API** ✓

#### Models (`backend/models.py`)
- `Appointment` model with relationships to User and Doctor
- `AppointmentStatus` enum

#### Schemas (`backend/schemas.py`)
- `AppointmentCreate` - For booking appointments
- `AppointmentUpdate` - For doctors to update status
- `AppointmentResponse` - With nested patient/doctor data

#### Router (`backend/routers/appointments.py`)
**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/appointments/` - Create appointment
- `GET /api/appointments/patient/my-appointments` - Get patient's appointments
- `GET /api/appointments/doctor/my-appointments?week=current` - Get doctor's weekly appointments
- `GET /api/appointments/{id}` - Get appointment details
- `PATCH /api/appointments/{id}` - Update appointment (doctor only)
- `DELETE /api/appointments/{id}` - Cancel appointment (patient)
- `GET /api/appointments/doctor/{doctor_id}/available-slots?date=YYYY-MM-DD` - Get available time slots

**Additional Endpoint (`backend/routers/doctors.py`):**
- `GET /api/doctors/all` - Get all active doctors for browsing

#### Authentication (`backend/auth.py`)
- Added `get_current_doctor()` function for doctor-only endpoints

### 3. **Frontend Components** ✓

#### API Services (`src/services/api.js`)
**New `appointmentAPI` object with methods:**
- `createAppointment(appointmentData)`
- `getPatientAppointments(statusFilter)`
- `getDoctorAppointments(week)`
- `getAppointmentDetails(appointmentId)`
- `updateAppointment(appointmentId, updateData)`
- `cancelAppointment(appointmentId)`
- `getAvailableSlots(doctorId, date)`
- `getAllDoctors()`

**Updated Token Handling:**
- Smart routing for appointment endpoints based on user type

#### Doctor Details Page (`src/pages/DoctorDetails.jsx` + CSS)
**Features:**
- Doctor profile display with avatar, specialization, phone
- Weekly schedule visualization
- Date picker (allows booking 1-30 days ahead)
- Dynamic time slot loading based on selected date
- Real-time availability checking
- Symptoms and notes input
- Professional gradient design
- Success confirmation and auto-redirect

#### Updated Doctor Home (`src/pages/DoctorHome.jsx`)
**Changes:**
- Changed "Today's Appointments" → **"This Week's Appointments"**
- Integrated real appointment data from API
- Shows patient profile pictures
- Displays appointment date, time, and symptoms
- Status badges with color coding
- Click-to-call functionality

#### App Routing (`src/App.jsx`)
- Added `/doctor/:doctorId` route for doctor details page

## 📋 How It Works

### Patient Flow:
1. **Browse Doctors**
   - Patient views available doctors (from AI recommendations or direct browsing)
   
2. **Select Doctor**
   - Click on doctor card → Navigate to `/doctor/{doctorId}`
   
3. **Book Appointment**
   - View doctor's profile and weekly schedule
   - Select date (tomorrow to 30 days ahead)
   - System fetches available time slots for that date
   - Select time slot (booked slots are disabled)
   - Enter symptoms and notes (optional)
   - Confirm appointment
   
4. **Manage Appointments**
   - View upcoming appointments in user dashboard
   - Cancel appointments if needed

### Doctor Flow:
1. **Set Schedule**
   - Go to Schedule page
   - Set weekly availability (days and time slots)
   
2. **View Appointments**
   - **Doctor Home** shows "This Week's Appointments"
   - See patient details, date, time, symptoms
   - Call patients directly
   
3. **Update Appointments**
   - Change status: pending → confirmed → completed
   - Add doctor notes
   - Mark no-shows

## 🎨 Design Features

### Professional Styling:
- **Gradient backgrounds** (Purple to blue)
- **Card-based layout** with shadows
- **Hover effects** and transitions
- **Color-coded status badges**
- **Responsive grid layouts**
- **Loading states** and spinners
- **Success/error messages**
- **Mobile-responsive** design

### UX Enhancements:
- Real-time slot availability
- Visual feedback for booked slots
- Date validation (no past dates)
- Form validation
- Auto-redirect after booking
- Click-to-call buttons
- Profile picture support

## 🗄️ Database Structure

```sql
appointments
├── id (PRIMARY KEY)
├── patient_id (FOREIGN KEY → users.id)
├── doctor_id (FOREIGN KEY → doctors.id)
├── appointment_date (DATE, YYYY-MM-DD)
├── time_slot (VARCHAR, "09:00 - 10:00")
├── status (ENUM: pending/confirmed/completed/cancelled/no_show)
├── symptoms (TEXT, nullable)
├── patient_notes (TEXT, nullable)
├── doctor_notes (TEXT, nullable)
├── created_at (TIMESTAMP)
└── updated_at (TIMESTAMP)

INDEXES:
- patient_id, doctor_id, appointment_date, status
- Composite index on (doctor_id, appointment_date)

CONSTRAINTS:
- UNIQUE (doctor_id, appointment_date, time_slot)
```

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**
   - All appointment endpoints require JWT token
   - Separate tokens for patients and doctors

2. **Authorization Checks**
   - Patients can only view/cancel their own appointments
   - Doctors can only view/update their own appointments
   - Doctor-only endpoints protected with `get_current_doctor()`

3. **Input Validation**
   - Date format validation (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Future date enforcement
   - Status enum validation
   - Text field length limits

4. **Double-Booking Prevention**
   - Unique constraint on (doctor_id, date, time_slot)
   - Real-time availability checking

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Create Appointment (Frontend)
```javascript
const appointmentData = {
  doctor_id: 1,
  appointment_date: "2025-10-15",
  time_slot: "09:00 - 10:00",
  symptoms: "Headache and fever for 2 days",
  patient_notes: "Prefer morning appointment"
};

const result = await appointmentAPI.createAppointment(appointmentData);
if (result.success) {
  console.log("Appointment booked:", result.data);
}
```

### Get Doctor's Weekly Appointments
```javascript
const result = await appointmentAPI.getDoctorAppointments('current');
// Returns appointments for current week (Monday-Sunday)
```

### Get Available Slots
```javascript
const result = await appointmentAPI.getAvailableSlots(doctorId, "2025-10-15");
// Returns: { slots: [{ time_slot: "09:00 - 10:00", available: true }, ...] }
```

## 🔄 Status Workflow

```
pending → confirmed → completed
   ↓
cancelled/no_show
```

- **pending**: Initial state when patient books
- **confirmed**: Doctor confirms the appointment
- **completed**: Appointment finished
- **cancelled**: Patient/doctor cancelled
- **no_show**: Patient didn't show up

## 📱 Frontend Integration Points

### In Patient Dashboard:
```jsx
// Add navigation to doctor details
<button onClick={() => navigate(`/doctor/${doctorId}`)}>
  Book Appointment
</button>
```

### In AI Consultation:
```jsx
// When doctor is recommended
const doctor = recommendations[0];
<button onClick={() => navigate(`/doctor/${doctor.id}`)}>
  Book with Dr. {doctor.name}
</button>
```

### In User Home:
```jsx
// Show all doctors from database
const doctors = await appointmentAPI.getAllDoctors();
doctors.map(doctor => (
  <DoctorCard 
    doctor={doctor}
    onBook={() => navigate(`/doctor/${doctor.id}`)}
  />
))
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes** on frequently queried columns
2. **Composite indexes** for date-range queries
3. **Lazy loading** of time slots (only when date selected)
4. **Efficient queries** with proper JOINs
5. **Response caching** possibilities
