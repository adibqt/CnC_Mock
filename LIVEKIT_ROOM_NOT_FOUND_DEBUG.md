# LiveKit Room Not Found - Diagnostic Guide

## The Error

```
Error getting room info: Room appointment_5_consultation not found
```

**Browser**: `could not createOffer with closed peer connection`

## What This Means

LiveKit rooms are **ephemeral**:
- Room is created when **first person joins**
- Room is **automatically deleted** when last person leaves or after timeout
- Room doesn't exist until someone actually connects

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Doctor Left Before Patient Joined ‚ùå
```
1. Doctor clicks "Join Call" ‚Üí Room created
2. Doctor's video loads briefly
3. Doctor closes tab/browser ‚Üí Room deleted
4. Patient tries to join ‚Üí "Room not found"
```

**Solution**: Doctor must **stay in the call** for patient to join

### Scenario 2: Room Status Checking Before Creation ‚úÖ
```
1. Patient polling checks room ‚Üí Not found (normal)
2. Doctor clicks "Join Call" ‚Üí Room being created...
3. Patient poll checks again ‚Üí Not found (room still creating)
4. Doctor fully connected ‚Üí Room now exists
5. Next patient poll ‚Üí Room found! ‚Üí Notification shows
```

**This is normal behavior** - polls will show "not found" until doctor is fully connected

### Scenario 3: Network/Connection Issues ‚ùå
```
1. Doctor clicks "Join Call"
2. Token fetched successfully
3. Connection to LiveKit fails ‚Üí Room never created
4. Patient sees no notification
```

**Check**:
- LiveKit server URL accessible: `wss://cncmock-klusg79b.livekit.cloud`
- Firewall not blocking WebSocket connections
- Browser console for connection errors

## Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Verify Doctor Stays Connected

**Doctor Side**:
1. Click "Join Video Call"
2. Wait for "‚úÖ Successfully connected to room: appointment_X_consultation" in console
3. **Keep the call window open**
4. Don't close tab or navigate away

**Check Browser Console**:
```javascript
‚úÖ üé• Fetching LiveKit token for appointment: 5 userType: doctor
‚úÖ ‚úÖ LiveKit token received: {roomName: 'appointment_5_consultation', ...}
‚úÖ ‚úÖ Successfully connected to room: appointment_5_consultation
‚úÖ üë§ Participant: Dr. Smith
```

### 2. Patient Checks While Doctor is Connected

**Patient Side** (different browser/incognito):
1. Login as patient
2. Go to appointments
3. Wait 5-10 seconds for polling
4. Check console for room status checks:

```javascript
// Before doctor joins
{is_active: false, participant_count: 0, room_name: 'appointment_5_consultation'}

// After doctor joins
{is_active: true, participant_count: 1, room_name: 'appointment_5_consultation'}
```

### 3. Backend Logs Analysis

**While doctor is in call**, backend should show:
```
INFO: Generated LiveKit token for user X in room appointment_5_consultation
INFO: Room appointment_5_consultation is active with 1 participants
```

**When patient tries to join**:
```
INFO: Generated LiveKit token for user Y in room appointment_5_consultation
INFO: Room appointment_5_consultation is active with 2 participants
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Doctor clicks "Join Call"
- [ ] Doctor sees their own video/camera
- [ ] Doctor console shows "Successfully connected"
- [ ] **Doctor keeps the call window open** (don't close!)
- [ ] Patient waits 5-10 seconds
- [ ] Patient sees notification: "Dr. [Name] is calling..."
- [ ] Patient clicks "Join Call"
- [ ] Patient connects to same room
- [ ] Both see each other

## If Patient Still Can't Join

### Check 1: Doctor Actually Connected?

**Doctor Console Must Show**:
```
‚úÖ Successfully connected to room: appointment_5_consultation
```

**Not just**:
```
‚úÖ LiveKit token received  ‚Üê This is not enough!
```

The token being received doesn't mean connected. Connection happens after.

### Check 2: Room Name Consistency

**Backend logs should show**:
```
Generated LiveKit token for user X in room appointment_5_consultation
```

**Not**:
```
Generated LiveKit token for user X in room appointment_5  ‚Üê Wrong!
Generated LiveKit token for user X in room room_5  ‚Üê Wrong!
```

### Check 3: LiveKit Server Reachable

Test in browser console:
```javascript
// Check if LiveKit URL is accessible
fetch('https://cncmock-klusg79b.livekit.cloud')
  .then(r => console.log('LiveKit server reachable'))
  .catch(e => console.error('Cannot reach LiveKit server:', e));
```

### Check 4: Token Expiration

Tokens expire after 24 hours. If testing over multiple days, old tokens won't work.

**Solution**: Always fetch fresh token when joining (which the code already does).

## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Doctor closes tab immediately
Room gets deleted, patient can't join.

### ‚ùå Using different browsers for testing without incognito
Tokens/sessions may conflict.

### ‚ùå Not waiting for connection
Doctor clicks join ‚Üí immediately checks if patient can see ‚Üí too fast, room still connecting.

### ‚ùå Wrong room name in code
If doctor joins `appointment_5_consultation` but patient polls for `room_5` ‚Üí won't match.

## Expected Flow (Step by Step)

**Time 0:00 - Doctor Joins**
```
Doctor: Click "Join Video Call"
Backend: Generates token for appointment_5_consultation
Doctor Browser: Connects to LiveKit
LiveKit Server: Creates room appointment_5_consultation
Doctor: Sees own video
```

**Time 0:05 - Patient Polling**
```
Patient Browser: Checks /livekit/room-status/5 (every 5s)
Backend: Queries LiveKit for appointment_5_consultation
LiveKit: Reports 1 participant (doctor)
Patient: Notification appears!
```

**Time 0:10 - Patient Joins**
```
Patient: Clicks "Join Call"
Backend: Generates token for appointment_5_consultation (same room)
Patient Browser: Connects to LiveKit
LiveKit Server: Adds patient to existing room
Both: See each other!
```

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Check if room exists on LiveKit server
```python
# In backend terminal
python -c "
import asyncio
from services.livekit_service import livekit_service

async def check():
    try:
        info = await livekit_service.get_room_info('appointment_5_consultation')
        print('Room found:', info)
    except Exception as e:
        print('Room not found:', e)

asyncio.run(check())
"
```

### Force create a room
```python
# In backend terminal
python -c "
import asyncio
from services.livekit_service import livekit_service

async def create():
    try:
        room = await livekit_service.create_room('test_room_123', 10)
        print('Room created:', room)
    except Exception as e:
        print('Failed to create room:', e)

asyncio.run(create())
"
```

## Key Takeaway

**LiveKit rooms don't persist without participants!**

The doctor must be **actively connected and in the call** for the patient to join. The room doesn't exist as a "waiting room" - it only exists while someone is connected to it.

This is by design for security and cost optimization. Empty rooms are automatically cleaned up.
