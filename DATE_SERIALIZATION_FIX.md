# Date Serialization Fix

## Issue
When creating or retrieving appointments, the API was returning a 500 Internal Server Error with the following validation error:

```
fastapi.exceptions.ResponseValidationError: 1 validation errors:
  {'type': 'string_type', 'loc': ('response', 'appointment_date'), 'msg': 'Input should be a valid string', 'input': datetime.date(2025, 10, 14)}
```

## Root Cause
The database was storing `appointment_date` as a **date object** (`datetime.date`) instead of a string. However, the Pydantic response model (`AppointmentResponse`) expected the field to be a **string**.

When SQLAlchemy retrieved the appointment from the database, it returned the date as a Python `datetime.date` object, which couldn't be serialized to JSON directly by FastAPI.

## Solution
Added date-to-string conversion logic in all appointment endpoints before returning the response:

```python
# Convert appointment_date to string if it's a date object
appointment_date_str = apt.appointment_date
if hasattr(appointment_date_str, 'strftime'):
    appointment_date_str = appointment_date_str.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
```

This checks if the date has a `strftime` method (meaning it's a date/datetime object) and converts it to the string format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

## Endpoints Fixed

1. **POST `/api/appointments/`** - Create appointment
2. **GET `/api/appointments/patient/my-appointments`** - Get patient's appointments
3. **GET `/api/appointments/doctor/my-appointments`** - Get doctor's appointments
4. **GET `/api/appointments/{appointment_id}`** - Get appointment details
5. **PATCH `/api/appointments/{appointment_id}`** - Update appointment

## Testing
After the fix, appointments should:
- ✅ Create successfully with success message
- ✅ Display in patient dashboard under "Schedule"
- ✅ Show in doctor's "This Week's Appointments"
- ✅ Return proper JSON responses without validation errors

## Technical Details

### Before Fix:
```python
"appointment_date": apt.appointment_date  # Returns datetime.date(2025, 10, 14)
```

### After Fix:
```python
appointment_date_str = apt.appointment_date
if hasattr(appointment_date_str, 'strftime'):
    appointment_date_str = appointment_date_str.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
# Returns "2025-10-14" as a string
```

## Why This Happened
The database column type for `appointment_date` was likely defined as `DATE` in PostgreSQL or a similar date type in the database, which SQLAlchemy automatically maps to Python's `datetime.date` type. While the input validation accepts strings and converts them, the output wasn't being converted back to strings for JSON serialization.

## Prevention
For future reference, you can either:
1. Keep using string conversion (current approach - flexible and safe)
2. Update the model to use `Date` type from SQLAlchemy with custom JSON serialization
3. Use a Pydantic validator with `@validator` to handle the conversion automatically

The current approach is the most straightforward and doesn't require model changes.
